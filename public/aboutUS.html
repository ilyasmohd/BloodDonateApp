                        instead of promoting the positive values of humanity certain evil elements are engaged in developing
                        rift and hatred among us. In this context it is the responsibility of every peace-loving citizen
                        of this country to introduce the positive teachings and to promote mutual love, confidence and understanding
                        between the members of various communities and religions. All India Payam-e-Insaniyat (The Message
                        of Humanity) Forum is non-political, non-religious, social organization. This organization is committed
                        to promote the basic human values among all citizens of India irrespective of cast, creed or religion
                        purely on the basis of humanity.

                        <p class="text-justify">Maulana Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi aka "Ali Miyan" (1914-1999) was an illustrious member of the family
                            of Rae Bareli which is credited for producing intellectuals and writers for generations. Moulana
                            Ali Miya was a great thinker, writer, educationist, social reformer, and an international traveler.
                            He was very humble, modest, soft-spoken, tolerant, moderate and generous. He stood for mutual
                            respect, peaceful coexistence, human values, establishing a social atmosphere based on tolerance
                            and harmony in India and in the world at large. He earned our country good name for his services
                            that were also internationally recognized. He served as the chairman of the board for the center
                            of Islamic studies of the Oxford university and as a visiting professor in a number of international
                            universities. In 1980, he received the Faisal International Award, followed by the Brunei Award
                            and the UAE Award in 1999. He also received an honorary doctorate from Kashmir University on
                            29 October 1981.He will always be remembered for his efforts in fostering and promoting love
                            and amity between different communities and sections of the society. He traveled around India
                            to rebuild relations between communities on the terms of common moral values. He established
                            a movement named "Payam-e-Insaniyat" (Message of Humanity) forum and toured along with his friends,
                            comprising of people from different communities, to certain places where communal riots had erupted,
                            to instill conﬁdence among the victims and to bring the aggressors and wrongdoers

                <p class="text-justify mt-2"> The present volatile and dangerous situation in the country demands that the message of the late Moulana
                    be reiterated and repeated time and again. The way to peaceful coexistence lies in highlighting the message
                    of humanity. What Moulana said about quarter of a century ago has become more relevant today in the context
                    of rising aggressive behavior of some violent groups and organizations for which innocent people become
                    a soft target of violence and destruction. His concern about the rising corruption in various ﬁelds and
                    its remedy too are as fresh as they were in the past. to the right path.
